  Out in the Zone, there is a tribe of beings that are different from all others. They are not human mutants and they are not wild beasts – they are both. They are animals, but they walk upright on their hind legs, use tools and have a spoken language – primitive and coarse, but a language nonetheless. They are newcomers to the Zone, on their guard or even hostile to strangers. Despite their few numbers the beast mutants seem to belong to several different species – some look like ragged dogs or wolves, others are short and rodent-like, and a third variety are monkey-like climbers. The truth is that the beast mutants – like the People themselves – can trace their origin to the genetics labs of the Ancients, bred to be able to survive the harsh world after the Apocalypse. They are animals given parts of the human intellect and fine motor skills. The small tribe that recently arrived in the Zone has fled from an old research facility located in a distant mountain range, where many of their kin still are being held captive by the mysterious Watchers. The escapees have journeyed to the area of the Zone to find a new home.
